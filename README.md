# 🍏🍊 Fruit Detection & Counting | Image Segmentation  

This project implements **image segmentation and object detection** to identify and count **fruits** from tree images. The model is trained on **oranges, apples, and other fruits**, detecting them using **bounding boxes** and counting their occurrences.  

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ Detects and segments fruits in images  
✔️ Places **bounding boxes** around detected fruits  
✔️ Counts the total number of fruits  
✔️ Trained on **apples, oranges, and other fruits**  
✔️ Uses **Deep Learning** for object detection  

## 📂 Dataset  
The model is trained on a custom dataset containing images of **fruit-bearing trees**, labeled with bounding boxes.

## 📌 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NumPy, Matplotlib
